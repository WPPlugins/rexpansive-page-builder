The new and awesome plugin to build a page in 1 minute! Expand your mind! This is a test version!

== Description ==

### Rexpansive Builder – Wordpress Plugin

Create a unique and creative layout in total relax, thanks to expansion which lets you enlarge or move photos and texts, without having to set anything up. As of today creating a layout is simple, you’ll realize as soon as you insert photos or texts. With a straightforward expansion your layouts will be spectacular! Try here, right now!

### Automatic grid

Our aim was to create a builder which was simple to use and as clean as possible, as today all the builders available on the market have too many functions and are so messy! Too many windows and numbers to enter. Thanks to this revolutionary approach, your user experience is improved by far because you can set the size of each element with the expansion and by looking at the page as a whole it’ll be much easier for you to create a nice web page quickly. We asked a dozen friends who used other page builders to test Rexpansive and they told us that with our builder they saved a lot of time to do the same things. The secret of our product is that users don’t have to think about how to edit the width or height of the different elements: this process needs to be natural.

### Page builder with material design. Clear and neat.

A design that knows how to help you understand the functionality in the least time possible, because we know that your time is precious, and it is for this reason that we have eliminated superfluous texts and descriptions from the user interface.

Everything has been replaced by icons, syles and a layout designed specifically which will help you understand the functionality you need to use straight away, so that you don’t waste time trying to understand things you don’t need.

### One of the characteristics of Rexpansive is that using it is like playing a “game”!

Yes, really! When you drag, enlarge or reduce elements you’ll feel like you’re playing a game, as the system will automatically drag elements to leave more space to those you want to emphasize, but you can also enjoy entering and placing the different elements as you like.

### You’ll see, as soon as you start using Rexpansive it’ll be love at first sight and you’ll never stop using it!
